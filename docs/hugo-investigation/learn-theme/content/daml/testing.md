Scenarios emulate the ledger. You can specify a linear sequence of actions that various parties take, and these are evaluated in order, according to the same consistency, authorization, and privacy rules as they would be on the sandbox ledger or ledger server. [DAML Studio]({{< relref "studio.md" >}}) shows you the resulting Transaction graph.

For more on how scenarios work, see the [Examples]({{< relref "#examples" >}}) below.
