This page specifies the major features weâ€™re planning to add next to the
DAML SDK. Plans and timelines are subject to change. If you need any of
these features or want to request others, see the `/support/support`
page for how to get in touch.

We plan to update this roadmap roughly every three months.

- **Generic templates**
    
    Support for writing generic templates - for example, a generic
    `Proposal` workflow that could be instantiated as a `Proposal Iou`
    to propose an `Iou`.

    GitHub](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/issues/1387).

- **Tools to suggest improvements to DAML code**

- **Upgrading contracts**
    
    Improved support for the workflows of upgrading contracts that
    already exist on the ledger.

- **Tools for visualisation**
    
    Tools that allow users to visualise the static workflow and
    lifecycle of contracts.
 - **Improve app portability between DAML ledgers**
    
    Add a DAML-on-X certification tool that tests that DAML ledgers
    implement all DAML functionality, and document a portable approach
    to DAML application testing.

    Add Ledger API authentication for all DAML ledgers.

- **JavaScript ecosystem**
    
    Improve the currently experimental Node.js bindings so they are
    stable, and add higher-level abstractions to capture recurring usage
    patterns.

- **DAML-on-X self-service package: Beta release**
    
    Make it easier for external developers to integrate DAML with other
    ledgers.
    
    You can read about the release stages on the
    `/daml-integration-kit/index` page.
